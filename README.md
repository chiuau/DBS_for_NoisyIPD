This repository contains the source code of the Derived Belief Strategy (DBS) for the Noisy Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. The strategy took third place in the 20th Anniversary Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Competition’s “Noise” category. It is the best performer among programs that had no “slave” programs feeding points to them. 

There are several implementations of DBS, and the best performer among them is DBSz.java. This repository also includes the source code of the IPD simulator being used in the competition.
